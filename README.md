# LATFinders: ARA Project

## Project Idea:

To support student’s decision to choose a course based on other student's reviews, so they can: 

* Get overall and detailed view about courses.
* Compare courses from different universities and make it easier to choose a course.
* Predict the future trend of course overall ratings based on previous students’ ratings.
